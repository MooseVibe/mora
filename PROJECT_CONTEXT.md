# Mora — Project Context

Read this file first in every new chat before making assumptions or asking setup questions.

## What This Is

Mora is an online tarot reader. The MVP already works; the current phase is polishing existing screens and UI, not rebuilding the product from scratch.

North Star: an AI tarot reader in chat. The daily card and journal are retention mechanics that keep the product useful until the AI reader is ready.

## Tech Snapshot

- Framework: Next.js 14 App Router
- Language: TypeScript / React
- Styling: vanilla CSS, no Tailwind or UI library
- Auth and database: Supabase
- Path alias: `@/*` -> `./src/*`
- Local dev URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Production: `mora-vnkt.vercel.app`

## Start The App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Default dev server: `http://localhost:3000`.

If port 3000 is busy, use:

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

Then try `3002` if needed.

## Main App Areas

- `/` -> landing and unauthenticated daily card flow via `src/components/TaroApp.tsx`
- `/auth` -> login and save-card auth flow
- `/dashboard` -> authenticated daily card dashboard
- `/journal` -> authenticated card journal
- `/api/draws` -> stores drawn cards in Supabase

## Important Files

- `CLAUDE.md` -> agent rules and working conventions
- `docs/project.md` -> product idea, audience, phase, north star
- `docs/architecture.md` -> stack, structure, commands, environment
- `docs/design-system.md` -> visual language, colors, animation principles
- `docs/features.md` -> current MVP, WIP, planned features
- `docs/decisions.md` -> decisions log
- `directives/` -> task workflows for redesigns, features, and bugs
- `docs/competitors.md` -> competitor analysis and market notes

## Current Product State

Working MVP:

- Google auth and email auth
- unauthenticated daily card draw
- authenticated daily card draw, limited to once per day
- automatic save to journal
- dashboard with daily card and recent cards
- journal with drawn card history

Current work phase:

- UI redesign and polish for existing screens
- dashboard and journal are the active areas
- AI tarot chat is planned later, after the product feels presentable

## Working Rules

Before edits:

1. Read this file.
2. Read the relevant detailed doc in `docs/`.
3. Inspect the actual code before changing behavior.
4. Keep changes scoped to the user's request.

Do not rewrite working mechanics during UI work. Preserve auth, card draw, save, journal, and pending-draw sync behavior unless the user explicitly asks to change them.

After meaningful product, architecture, or visual decisions, update `docs/decisions.md`.
